# Windows Server Home Lab Project

## Overview
This project documents my beginner IT home lab where I set up a Windows Server 2019 virtual machine in VirtualBox. The goal is to build practical skills for entry level IT and cybersecurity roles, including installing Active Directory and configuring a domain environment.

## Tools
- VirtualBox (virtualization platform)
- Windows Server 2019 Evaluation ISO
- Host OS: Windows 11

## Steps Taken
1. Installed VirtualBox on host machine
2. Downloaded Windows Server 2019 ISO from Microsoft Eval Center
3. Created new VM in VirtualBox:
   - Name: Windows Server 2019
   - RAM: 4 GB
   - Disk: 50 GB dynamically allocated VDI
4. Mounted ISO in VM optical drive
5. Booted VM from ISO
6. Installed Windows Server 2019 Standard (Desktop Experience)
7. Created Administrator password and logged in successfully

## Next Steps
- Install Active Directory Domain Services role
- Promote server to Domain Controller
- Set up client VM and join domain
- Practice creating users, groups, and policies

## Notes
I am documenting this as part of my job search preparation to showcase hands-on experience with Windows Server environments.
